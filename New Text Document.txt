Why built-in model.fit() is Faster than custom training loop?

1️⃣ Built-in XLA Optimization 🚀

model.fit() utilizes TensorFlow's optimized computation graphs for faster execution.

2️⃣ Efficient Data Pipeline ⚡
Uses tf.data.Dataset for automatic batching, shuffling, and prefetching.

3️⃣ GPU/TPU Optimization 🔥
Works seamlessly with multi-GPU and TPU training without extra code.

4️⃣ Automatic Loss Calculation 📉
No need to manually calculate gradients using tf.GradientTape().
